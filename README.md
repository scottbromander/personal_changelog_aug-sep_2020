# Scott Bromander Change Log

### Overview
This is a personal changelog of my updates. Not everything is code. I wanted to create visability around the behaviors and habits for my students. Note that this log is starting as of August 26th, 2020 and it not a full description of what I have read and courses I have taken. Highlights of past reading and courses can be found here! (Eventually)
